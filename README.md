Verxio is a decentralized social network designed for connecting crypto talents and founders within the opBNB ecosystem. Verxio serves as a hub for talent discovery and project management, facilitating seamless collaboration and innovation in the crypto industry. As a do-to-earn platform, project founders and protocols fund a reward pool that is task-based. Talents can earn tokens, incentives, and NFT badges as much as they participate in these tasks.
